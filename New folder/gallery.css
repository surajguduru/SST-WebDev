/* Your task is to implement a collapsible sidebar for a web application. */
/* You have two main div elements provided in the HTML: a sidebar (#sidebar) and a main content area (#main-content).
The sidebar should start fully expanded with a width of 250px. The main content should be displayed to the right, filling the rest of the viewport width.
Include a button (#toggle-button) within the sidebar that will toggle its expanded and collapsed states.
The sidebar should collapse to a width of 80px when the toggle button is clicked and expand back to 250px when clicked again.
The main content area should adjust its position so it's always visible and using the available space next to the sidebar (it should have a padding of 80px).
Apply CSS to enhance the visual appearance according to the specifications given.
Specifications
The sidebar should have a background color of #34495e and contain white text. It should also have a padding of 15px 30px
The toggle button should have a background color of #e74c3c, which changes to #c0392b when hovered over.
The main content area should have a background color of #f1c40f.
Instructions for Implementation
Write JavaScript code in script.js to add the toggle functionality to the sidebar.
Write CSS in style.css to style the sidebar, the toggle button, and the main content area according to the given specifications.
Ensure the main content area adjusts its position dynamically when the sidebar is toggled.
Example Behavior
Initially, the sidebar is fully expanded with a width of 250px.
Clicking the #toggle-button collapses the sidebar to 80px, allowing the main content area to use the additional space.
Clicking the #toggle-button again expands the sidebar back to 250px. */
